### Hello there, I'm Ean ðŸ‘‹

- I build frontend, backend, and occasionally marry themâ€”then maintain their ancient codebase. 
- Speak fluent `.js`, `.go`, and learning `.rs` (Rusty but trying).
- Build [Ayat Pocket](http://ayat.my.id/): a mobile-friendly Quran viewer in VanillaJS.
- Occasionally whisper to legacy code and hope it doesn't break.
